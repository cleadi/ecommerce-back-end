# E-Commerce Back End
Boot Camp HW # 11

## Project Description
- This e-commerce back-end application allows you to create, edit, and delete items from a SQL database.
- There is no front-end component for this application.
- To use this application, you'll need to clone the application to your local machine and install the dependencies listed in the package.json file.
- You'll also need to use a SQL database application such as MySQL and then run the schema.sql file to build the database locally.
- Once the database is built, you can seed the database using the terminal command "npm run seed."
- Using a REST API client, such as Insomnia Core or Postman, you can manage your database using the GET, POST, PUT, and DEL methods, as shown in the example walkthrough video below.
